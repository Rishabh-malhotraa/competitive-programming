Access my public [**notebook**](https://www.notion.so/brnpapa/icpc-notebook-0355e05508e9470fb065801e277f0c6c), a Notion workspace where I do my notes while studying and coding general-purpose algorithms. The book I use and recommend for studying is "Competitive Programming 3: The new lower bound of programming contests" by Steven Halim.
